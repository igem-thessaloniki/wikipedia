                            In order to achieve that we studied very carefully all safety regulations and they are a requirement

                            Before doing any expirements in the lab, our team have been <strong>adequately trained</strong> from the lab personnel to
                            perform experiments with <strong>minimal risks</strong> and <strong>manage problems</strong> that might arise. Moreover
                            the lab personnel is familiar with handling the organisms that we will be using and have extensive knowledge of the
                            procedures and protocols that we will be preforming.

                            Our lab <strong>biosafety</strong> is Level 1
                            <br>
                            The following safety protocols we apply
                            <ul>
                                <li>physical biosecurity</li>

                            </ul>
                            will prevent any organisms that we work with to escape the lab and threaten the enviroment.
                        </p>

                            E. coli K-12 derived strains pose little to no threat on healthy adults but may be harmful to
