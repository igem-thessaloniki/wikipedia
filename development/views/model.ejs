                        The goal of the model is to study the Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL)
                        as a network type in three systems that use different components critical
                        to the proper network operation. This function aims at balancing the final
                        product to a specific steady state, regardless of the input disruption. We
                        then responded to questions raised by the wet lab, thus helping towards the
                        right course of thought during experimental planning, as well as a better
                        understanding of the systems and the different choices that emerged. We
                        applied a sensitivity analysis to classify system parameters according to
                        their significance, and finally, we explored the robustness of our system
                        predictions by indentifying parameter sets and evaluating their cellular
                        behavior.

                    <h3>How IFFL works</h3>
                    <p>
                        The stability of a system in which IFFL is applied is represented by the
                        staying of its output at a constant level in the equilibrium state for each
                        change of input. In this type of network, the number of plasmids is the
                        input, which is variable and the final protein is the output of the system
                        that must remain constant at each change of input.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following figure, the input X is shown to be responsible for the
                        continuously increasing production of the gene of interest Z, as well as
                        for the production of the internal variable Y, which suppresses the
                        production of Z. As mentioned in [], the system is represented by a logical
                        AND gate, which expresses the effect of input X and suppressor Y on output
                        Z.

                                        The most important part is that you need to understand
                                        perfectly how the system should work and what each
                                        component of
                                        the system does. This means, that you have to arrange
                                        sessions
                                        with Wet lab where you will discuss about the system and
                                        you
                                        ask as many questions as you have. These sessions will
                                        never
                                        end, but it’s important to arrange as many as you can when
                                        starting off, in order to build a strong foundation on
                                        understanding your system and what it has to offer.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After that you will be confident enough to showcase the
                                        interactions happening in the system and create a
                                        mathematical
                                        representation of it. The mathematical representation in
                                        our
                                        case, were the Ordinary Differential Equations of the
                                        system
                                        and the chemical reactions happening between different
                                        components in the cell.

                                        Furthermore, for the model to be accurate it has to have
                                        well
                                        characterized parameters. For this, you can actually do
                                        many
                                        things. We combined sensitivity and robustness analysis
                                        alongside with a very extensive bibliography search. Our
                                        methods are described later in this section and you can
                                        find
                                        implementations of them on both TALE and dcas9-sgRNA
                                        models. As
                                        shown in Figure 1, it is important to take into account,
                                        that
                                        the condition that will break the characterization loop is
                                        different for each project and depends on what you want
                                        from
                                        your model and how accurate should it be.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And that’s it. After all these things, you have a model
                                        that
                                        tries its best to describe your system behaviour and
                                        estimate
                                        the concentration of the different components. But, we are
                                        not
                                        finished yet. Now you have to arrange new sessions with Wet
                                        lab, show them your system, describe to them what you did
                                        and
                                        answer all the questions they have, and most importantly,
                                        make
                                        decisions about the system design that you could not answer
                                        before. Now you can make any hypothesis for the system and
                                        actually test it with your model. You should though, take
                                        into
                                        consideration, that the model is an estimation of the
                                        reality
                                        and depending on the effort you put in the designing and
                                        characterizing it, you will get better or worse
                                        estimations. As
                                        an example, of how we used our models to help in the system
                                        design, you can take a look at TALE tuning with IPTG-LacI,
                                        dcas9-sgRNA repressor analysis, and dcas9 expression site
                                        decision. As a last part of our model, we also tested the
                                        implementation of IFFL in RNA level. On the other hand, an
                                        example of how we integrated Wet lab’s feedback into our
                                        model
                                        is shown in Dcas9 subsystem.

                                        Finally, when the experiments are finished you will have

                                        chance to take the experimental data and the model
                                        parameters
                                        into them. This could be as simple as using the data
                                        produced
                                        by robustness analysis and finding the parameter set with
                                        the
                                        minimum distance from the experimental data, as we did in
                                        TALE
                                        robustness analysis, or using methods like linear/non
                                        linear
                                        regression, bayesian estimation etc. The most experimental
                                        data
                                        you have, the better for the model characterization. In our
                                        case, the data we used [1] to fit the model was the system
                                        error and for this reason, we had limited options regarding
                                        what parameters we should fit to achieve the better
                                        results. To
                                        overpass this obstacle, we used the result from TALE
                                        sensitivity analysis that showed as what was the most
                                        influential parameters for the output and fitted them while
                                        fixing the others.

                                        Now you have a model, that is fitted to experimental
                                        results
                                        and you can use that model, if you want to continue your
                                        work
                                        in the system. If the experimental results, are not as
                                        expected, after fitting your model to them, you can
                                        optimize
                                        the parameters or use new components and continue by giving
                                        new
                                        feedback to Wet lab. Again for optimizing you can perform a
                                        new
                                        robustness analysis, because with it you can test
                                        extensively
                                        different sets from the parametric space save and analyze
                                        all
                                        the results as you want. Another option that we considered,
                                        is
                                        a gradient descend algorithm but as we didn’t used it in
                                        the
                                        end, we will not discuss further about it. If computational
                                        cost is not a problem for you, we would recommend
                                        robustness
                                        analysis, otherwise gradient descent algorithms or other
                                        Artificial Intelligence algorithms are the way to go.

                                        When we construct a computational model, there are many
                                        parameters that can not be identified, because it is likely
                                        that a similar experiment has not been carried out. Also,
                                        there is a chance where a similar experiment has been
                                        carried out, but for minor variations of the experimental
                                        arrangements, the changes in each parameter are large. It
                                        is therefore extremely useful to use a mathematical
                                        tool,the sensitivity analysis, with which we can come to
                                        many conclusions that will help us to evolve the model. The
                                        most important of them are[3]:

                                        <b>Factor prioritization:</b> One reason for using
                                        sensitivity analysis is to study the parameters in order to
                                        identify the most important ones. The most important ones,
                                        i.e. those with the highest sensitivity, are the ones that
                                        cause the greatest variation in the final output. By
                                        knowing what these are, we can focus on their precise
                                        measurement to reduce the variance of the final system,
                                        while providing a model that best approaches reality.

                                        most important to the less important, we can choose a fixed
                                        point for the non-critical parameters that lies within the
                                        originally defined range since it does not contribute much
                                        to the output variance. In this way, we can better observe
                                        the inter-relationships of important parameters in many
                                        system subunits that contain a large set of kinetic

                                        output, we
                                        can apply a series of sensitivity analyses, starting from
                                        all system inputs and investigating each time which
                                        parameters lead to greater sensitivity in output variance.
                                        By removing the parameters, that are the most influential,
                                        as long as they are characterized well for the biological
                                        system we are studying, then the output variance that
                                        remains is the sum of variations caused by the
                                        non-important parameters which is not big. This leads the
                                        system to fewer input parameters with less output variation
                                        and simultaneous reduction of computational cost.

                                        There are parameter interactions that for a particular

                                        present in large quantities, can lead to cell destruction,
                                        we need to explore the system's parameters, and find which

                                        On the contrary, Global sensitivity analysis simultaneously
                                        varies all parameters over the entire parameter space,
                                        which allows to simultaneously evaluate the relative

                                        variance [3]. Because of this, global sensitivity is more
                                        capable of approaching the parameters when non-linear

                                        Below we describe the procedure followed by the Sobol
                                        sensitivity analysis to calculate:

                                                output and to the contribution of the interaction
                                                between the pair of parameters respectively.</li>
                                            <li>Total-effect indices to calculate the contribution
                                                of a parameter in combination with its contribution

                                        The algorithmic analysis process begins by producing a
                                        sample from the input space of each parameter. This is done
                                        by quasi-random sequences that produce samples that are
                                        uniformly distributed in the area with small differences
                                        between them and are often used for monte carlo integration
                                        [3]. Then, for each set of parameters, the output of the
                                        system is calculated. Finally, Sobol indices are calculated
                                        by the procedure described below and the results are

                                    <p>For a system, the output of which is characterized by a

                                        x(x1,x2,x3). The first move is to decompose into the sums

                                        We can generalize (1) as follows
                                        <div id="fx-eq"></div>
                                        where n is the number of system inputs and i &lt; j,
                                        because fij(xi,xj) = fji(xj,xi).

                                        Then we define the variance D of the output function, of
                                        the total sums and the average of each parameter as a
                                        random variable, that is evenly distributed over an
                                        interval [4] and the result is the sum of the variance
                                        caused by each parameter or a combination of these in each
                                        set of parameters describing the total variance of the
                                        output as the following sum:

                                        <div id="d-eq"></div>
                                        where f(x) is square-integrable, therefore as total sums of
                                        the contribution of all the differences between the set
                                        parameters,
                                        <div id="d2-eq"></div>
                                        Equation (3) is analyzed as (1), and shows how much each
                                        variable has contributed, as well as their combined
                                        interactions in the final overall system variance.
                                        <div id="d3-eq"></div>
                                        where <span id="d1s-eq"></span> is the variance we have
                                        from specific parameters. For example, if we wanted the
                                        first order sensitivity index of variable we would use as a
                                        numerator only <span id="d1x-eq"></span>.

                                        Computational cost is proportional to the type of problem,
                                        the number of parameters and the non-linear phenomena that
                                        appear in the relationship between the interacting
                                        parameters. For small numbers of parameters like the model
                                        we have performed, variance-based methods are considered
                                        satisfactory and relatively quick. As the order of
                                        sensitivity indices increases, the cost increases
                                        accordingly. As mentioned above, one way to use a
                                        variance-based method like Sobol is to reduce the number of
                                        parameters (variance cutting) by excluding for each
                                        calculation those that do not affect.

                                    <p>
                                        When we start building a model, its structure contains many
                                        uncertainties that are not easy to assess. Such
                                        uncertainties are the mathematical expression of kinetic
                                        equations, stoichiometric coefficients of kinetics, and the
                                        simplifications made from a more complex network to a more
                                        simplified model. In addition, the complexity of biological
                                        systems makes it impossible to fully analyze all the
                                        reactions that occur inside and outside the environment,
                                        among the various components that they consist of.
                                        Robustness analysis is a tool useful for studying the
                                        general behavior of a system, despite the uncertainties
                                        that exist in it.
                                    </p>

                                        Applying robustness analysis to the mathematical model
                                        under study, we set price ranges for each parameter that we
                                        do not know, setting maximum and minimum values ​​that are
                                        considered realistic within the biological system, which
                                        are estimated from bibliography and experimental data. Then
                                        the model is exhaustively simulated in many sets of
                                        parameters created by sampling. The sampling method used is
                                        the Latin hypercube, which generates random numbers divided
                                        into equal intervals within the range given for each
                                        parameter. Within each interval a value is randomly
                                        selected.

                                        We use error bars in order to show the output variation
                                        around the mean value. They may correspond to a large range
                                        of parameter values that are spaced apart to several orders
                                        of magnitude between them. The error bars were calculated
                                        either by standard deviation of all concentrations for each
                                        copy number or by the corresponding standard error.

                                        Once, the sensitivity analysis described above, has been
                                        applied to reduce the number of uncertain parameters in the
                                        system, and robustness analysis to output values ​​that are
                                        highly variable, we can evaluate the results and better
                                        study the behavior of the system. In our system we studied
                                        the uncertainty of protein of interest concentrations at a
                                        time when all components of the system are stabilized in
                                        steady-state, relative to the copy number of the plasmids.

                                        results. The interaction between simbiology and python help

                                            We used RBS calculator from Salis Lab [5] to estimate the mRNA’ s translation rate for all proteins on our systems. The calculations are described in each model’s page. See translation rate estimation.
