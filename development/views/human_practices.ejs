                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        This year our Human Practice efforts were divided into 4 different
                        categories, each of them affecting our project and ourselves in a different
                        way. We focused on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>taking into serious consideration ethical issues regarding our
                                project</li>
                            <li>reaching out to field experts</li>
                            <li>interacting with people from the industry in order to investigate
                                various possibilities and options for our project</li>
                            <li>communicating science, synthetic biology and our project across
                                people of different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bioethics</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of top priorities during our project’s design and execution was that
                        our project would not raise any ethical concerns. So, we visited the
                        Hellenic National Bioethics Commission, where we discussed with Dr Vidalis.
                        After a presentation of our project and its possible applications, we
                        discussed about the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and the ethical
                        issues that may arise during the process of integrating this new scientific
                        field in statutory legislation. Dr Vidalis, evaluated our project and
                        concluded that it doesn’t directly raise any bioethical questions nor does
                        it pose any threat to individuals, society and the environment, but drew
                        our attention on the rules that should be followed in possible
                        applications. We agreed that many aspects of synthetic biology still need
                        regulation, as products of biological and technological advancements must
                        be utilised in a safe and risk avoiding way. Therefore, the existence of a
                        universal, well-established legislation, is necessary for an emerging field
                        like synthetic biology.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Academia</h4>
                    <p>As we work upon a foundational advance project, providing a genetic toolbox
                        that allows for increased control of gene expression, researchers will be
                        the first to utilize it. Therefore, their feedback would prove of great
                        importance to our project’s design and usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For that reason, we contacted numerous field experts, informing them about
                        our project. In addition, we created a synthetic biology survey that
                        investigates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>problems in research</li>
                            <li>our project’s usefulness</li>
                            <li>ethical issues that may arise</li>
                            <li>lab safety</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Survey Results</h4>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12">

                                                <div id="14-graph" class="plotly-graph-div"></div>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                </q-collapsible>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        From the survey result it can be deduced that, apart from funding, lack of
                        reproducibility and interlaboratory variations stand as significant
                        obstacles in research. On another note, researchers use plasmids with
                        different copy numbers for different purposes, which shows that control
                        over the expression level of the gene of interest can be useful.

                    <h4>Industry</h4>
                    <h4>Participation in the 83rd TIF</h4>
                    <p>TIF is the most important exhibition event in our country, taking place,
                        annually, in Thessaloniki. Entrepreneurship and innovation are celebrated
                        in TIF, as many leading companies and promising startups display their
                        innovative products and technological advancements. We had the opportunity
                        to participate in this year’s TIF and present our work to decades of
                        visitors every day. In addition, we came in contact with numerous
                        entrepreneurs, company representatives and people from the industry. This
                        allowed to establish a dialog with stakeholders, investigating possible
                        applications of our project beyond the lab.</p>

                    <h4>Education And Public Engagement</h4>

                    <p>
                        We focused our Public Engagement activities on communicating science across
                        different ages, scientific and cultural backgrounds through a plethora of
                        activities. Within the framework of our multifaceted outreach efforts, we
                        addressed students spanning from elementary school to university level.
                        Additionally, we participated in the OUC-iGEM Team Collaboration,
                        translating a synthetic biology comic book in our language, so that we
                        could provide an accessible and comprehensive visualisation of the
                        molecular mechanisms and engineering principles underlying synthetic
                        biology. As the highlight of our engagement activities, we organized the
                        “SynBalkans Tour”, a series of educational events in universities of 3
                        Balkan Peninsula countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia) about
                        the basics of Synthetic Biology and the iGEM Competition, with a broader
                        emphasis on approaching culturally different groups and establishing an
                        intercultural dialogue. More information can be found in our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Public_Engagement">Public

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Throughout our journey in the iGEM competition we gained valuable feedback
                        on various aspects of our project. We seeked for guidance and feedback from
                        experts of their field and stakeholders. Through their advice and
                        contribution, we improved our project’s design and broadened its possible
                        applications.</p>

                    <h4>Project Design and Modeling</h4>
                    <p>
                        As we came into communication with many scientists to inform them about our
                        project for this year’s iGEM Competition, we got some responses that shaped
                        our final project design.
                        We came in contact with Thomas H. Segall Shapiro (MIT), PhD. As our project
                        builds upon his work with stabilized promoters, we arranged a Video Call
                        with him. We explained to him the systems we were currently designing and
                        he gave us valuable feedback for the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>For our inducible system:</b> We discussed our concerns about
                                the implementation of the LacI repressor in the TAL Effector system
                                in order to achieve on-the-fly inducibility. Our concern was that
                                there would be steric hindrance between the TAL Effector and the
                                LacI repressor. For that reason, the system would not properly
                                function. He confirmed our concerns and advised us on the use of
                                another type of expression control. <b>So, we opted for the use of
                                    a riboswitch instead.</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>For our CRISPRi stabilisation system:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        We shared with him our idea to use another type of
                                        repressor instead of the TAL
                                        Effectors, to achieve promoter stabilization. We exhibited
                                        our idea to use CRISPRi
                                        and displayed our <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Design#dcas9-ttd">three
                                            Topology designs</a>
                                        , regarding the positioning(expression site) of dCas9. He
                                        told us that this system could possibly work if dCas9 was
                                        not expressed from the same plasmid as the sgRNA.
                                        <b>We followed his advice and, in order not to disturb the
                                            noncooperative repression, we chose to use <u>Topology
                                                C</u>.</b>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        He, also, mentioned that we should take into consideration
                                        the toxicity that dCas9 could pose for the cell.
                                        <b>That is why we investigated this issue and used pTet, an
                                            inducible promoter, to control dCas9 expression.</b>
                                        In order to choose a level of expression adequate for our
                                        system’s function that does not significantly affect
                                        growth, we conducted a dCas9 toxicity measurement,
                                        monitoring the growth of E. coli in different Doxycycline
                                        concentrations at a given time point.

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>For Fluorescence Measurements:</b>
                                As we had not decided on whether we would measure fluorescence
                                using a plate reader or a flow cytometer, we asked Thomas H. Segall
                                Shapiro his opinion on that matter. He guided us towards the use of
                                flow cytometry, as this method could provide us more accurate and
                                detailed results, and recommended us a
                                <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Thessaloniki/Experiments#flow-measurements">protocol</a>
                                he had worked on before.

                        Our <b>survey result</b> showed that there was not a clear preference
                        between on the fly <b>inducibility</b> or <b>tuning</b>
                        of stabilised promoters in order to achieve the required expression level.
                        Both designs have their own uses and advantages.
                        <br>
                        <b>So, we decided to include both of these options into our toolbox.</b>
                        For the tuning (of TAL effector) stabilised promoters, we included
                        <b>different promoter-RBS combinations</b>.
                        To achieve on the fly inducibility of the TAL Effector system we decided on
                        the use of a <b>riboswitch</b>
                        Therefore, in our contact with <b>Prof Howard M. Salis</b>, he ensured us
                        that <b>a theophylline riboswitch with a high dynamic range would be an
                            excellent choice</b>,
                        as theophylline readily enters bacterial cells, it is not metabolized by E.
                        coli, and it binds strongly to its RNA aptamer inside the riboswitch.
                        <br>
                        Regarding the <b>choice of fluorescent marker</b> he told us that both
                        sfGFP and RFP would work fine, but since the AEB--Theo-27 riboswitch
                        currently uses luciferase as the reporter gene of interest we couldn't
                        simply replace the current coding sequence (CDS) with another one. He
                        advised us to use luciferase as a reporter or create a fusion protein that
                        consists of the first 99 nucleotides of the currently used CDS
                        (luciferase), followed by our desired gene of interest without inserting a
                        stop or start codon in the middle of the CDS fusion. So, as we could not
                        measure luminescence levels we designed a
                        <b>fusion luciferase-sfGFP protein</b>.

                        We visited the <b>Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH (Centre of
                            Research & Technology Hellas)</b>
                        in Thessaloniki, Greece, where we discussed about our project with
                        scientists from the biotechnology field. Dr Antonios Makris, who is working
                        on metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces, informed us about copy number
                        variations in yeast and how they might affect the functionality of an
                        engineered system. Our conversation with him gave us the necessary
                        information to further investigate the usage of our stabilized systems in
                        yeast.

                    <p>
                        We also visited <b>Dr Tefas</b>, Associate Professor, School of
                        Informatics, AUTh, to ask about network optimization. After discussing
                        about our work and defining the optimization problem, he described to us
                        methods to find the optimal parameters for our systems. We ended up using
                        robustness analysis over a gradient descent algorithm as he suggested,
                        because computational cost was not a problem, as we didn't have many
                        unknown parameters or big ranges for their values.

                    <h4>Project Applications - Interaction with Stakeholders</h4>
                    <p>As we wanted to expand the purpose of our project and investigate its
                        possible applications outside of the lab we had meetings and discussions
                        with several stakeholders from our country.</p>
