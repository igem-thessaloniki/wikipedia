                        Our Team participated in iGEMs fifth Interlaboratory Study, a study
                        organized by IGEM Measurement Committee in order to identify and correct
                        the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements, so
                        that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs will be no
                        more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. This year’s
                        InterLab study aims to establish a GFP measurement protocol based on
                        engineering principles that anyone with a plate reader can use in their lab
                        and normalize fluorescence measurements to absolute cell count or colony
                        forming units (CFUs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To begin with our experiments we needed a plate reader that is qualified to
                        measure GFP fluorescence and OD600. In our city, there was no such an
                        instrument so we travelled to Alexandroupoli, at the Democritus University
                        of Thrace, where we used the Perkin Elmer EnSpine Multimode Plate Reader.
                        For all of the callibration protocols and cell measurements we adjusted the
                        exitation and emission settings to 485nm and 520nm respectively, the number
                        of flashes used was 10 and black plates with clear flat bottom were used.

                    <h3>Calibration Protocols:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before starting the plate reader measurements , we obtained the OD600
                        reference point, the particle standard curve and then the fluorescein
                        standard curve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The OD600 reference point was calculated by using LUDOX CL-X suspension to
                        obtain a conversion factor to transform Absorbance (Abs600) data from the
                        plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurements that would be obtained in
                        a spectrophotometer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, we obtained the particle standard curve by preparing a dilution
                        series of mono disperse silica microspheres and measuring the Abs600 in the
                        plate reader.

                    <p>
                        The last calibration protocol was conducted to generate the fluorescence
                        standard curve by preparing a dilution series of fluorescein and then
                        measuring the fluorescence in the plate reader. Fluorescein is a small
                        molecule which has similar excitation and emission properties to GFP, but
                        also cost effective and easy to handle.

                    <p>
                        The standard curve slopes showed a somewhat polynomial shape although they
                        were supposed to have a 1:1 slope. This could be due to a consistent
                        pipetting error or because of the over saturation of the detector.

                        Each one of the 6 test devices has a different Anderson promoter. So, we
                        are expecting different fluorescence levels for each device depending on
                        the Anderson promoter used.

                        All the plasmids were successfully transformed into DH5a chemically

                        overnight (14-16 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.

                        Devices 1 and 5 did not grow until the 6 hour timepoint, so the resulted
                        fluorescence is not representative of the promoters strenght. In addition,
                        Device 4, which had the strongest Anderson Promoter, did not grow as much
                        as the other Devices but still the Fluorescence was high. All the other
                        devices grew normally and the results we aqcuired were the ones expected.
                        Conclusively, we completed our Cell Measurement Protocol with success.
