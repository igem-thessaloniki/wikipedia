                        As a project competing in the foundational advance track, we faced
                        difficulties in our efforts to properly communicate our work. We contacted
                        Asterios Arampatzis, Team Leader of iGEM Greece 2017, in order to gain some
                        insight about the problems they may have met and dealt with, regarding the
                        communication of Synthetic Biology and their project to the world. He
                        shared with us his experience, stating that synthetic biology is nearly
                        absent from our country, as the public has not been properly informed and
                        there are not many researchers in the field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This year, we wanted to make sure that the iGEM Foundation, and synthetic
                        biology in general, would come in attention of a larger audience. We aimed
                        to inform people of various ages, scientific backgrounds and nationalities
                        about this new and exciting, yet relatively unknown in our country,
                        scientific field, raise awareness about genetic engineering, discuss about
                        the important ethical issues that come up with synthetic biology’s constant
                        growth and receive valuable feedback for our project’s application and
                        importance to the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We organized numerous activities, differentiating our approach depending on
                        the audience. In order to familiarize them with synthetic biology we
                        presented several iGEM projects from previous years that we believed,
                        demonstrate that synthetic biology can prove beneficial in real world
                        problems. We, also, wanted to communicate our project, so wee could gain
                        some feedback and understand the public’s reception of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, taking into consideration public’s feedback, we wanted to address
                        the issue of science communication to the public. So, the <b>highlight of
                            our
                            activities</b> this year was the organization of the <b>“SynBalkans
                            Tour”</b>, an
                        educational effort in order to broaden the knowledge about synthetic
                        biology in the Balkan Region, considering the different cultural and
                        scientific background of the audience.

                                    <p>
                                        The highlight of our public engagement efforts was the
                                        organization of the <b>“SynBalkans Tour”</b>, a series of
                                        events
                                        dedicated to science communication across the Balkan
                                        region.
                                        Through this tour, our goal was to form <b>a lasting
                                            scientific</b>
                                        cooperation between institutes in the Balkan Peninsula and
                                        provide students with the opportunity to get acquainted
                                        with a
                                        novel scientific branch, synthetic biology.

                                    <h4>Before the event</h4>

                                    <p>
                                        Before going on tour, we wanted to make sure that we would
                                        be
                                        able to engage people with different cultural and
                                        scientific
                                        backgrounds. We came in contact with professors and
                                        students
                                        from the <b>Department of Balkan Slavic and Oriental
                                            Studies,
                                            University of Macedonia</b>. We learned about the <b>cultural
                                            differences</b> between Balkan countries, so that we
                                        could
                                        differentiate our approach in each country, always taking
                                        into
                                        consideration their respective cultural and religious
                                        beliefs.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Apart from cultural differences we, also, had to take into
                                        account the <b>different scientific</b> background of the
                                        people going
                                        to attend our event, as synthetic biology is characterized
                                        by
                                        interdisciplinarity. For this reason, we chose to
                                        differentiate
                                        the content of our presentation, discussing about synthetic
                                        biology applications that are closer to the participants’
                                        academic interests.

                                        Along with our project, we used exemples from last year’s
                                        iGEM

                                        In 5 days, we visited 4 universities in 3 different
                                        countries:

                                        Students with an academic background in agriculture were
                                        especially eager to know how genetically engineered

                                        We prepared a short presentation that introduced the
                                        audience in the principles and basic tools of Synthetic
                                        Biology. First, we <b>introduced our team</b> to the
                                        audience.
                                        Next, we explained the <b>principles of synthetic biology</b>
                                        and
                                        mentioned some of its <b>applications</b> (i.e. quorum
                                        sensing,
                                        metabolic engineering, biosensors). Then, we presented our
                                        project, <b>Galene</b>, as well as projects of previous
                                        years’
                                        iGEM Teams to demonstrate the use of synthetic biology. The
                                        projects used in each presentation were selected depending
                                        on the participants <b>field of study</b>. Since <b>bioethics</b>
                                        and

                                        project’s
                                        design and execution, we highlighted the efforts of the
                                        aforementioned projects to address these issues.

                                        After we wrapped up our presentation, we discussed with
                                        students and professors about synthetic biology and the
                                        iGEM Competition. Students showed interest in learning more
                                        about the engineering principles of synthetic biology. We
                                        were happy to elaborate on the use of logic gates and
                                        explain them terms such as orthogonality and robustness.

                                        Finally, students were asked to complete a short
                                        questionnaire. Here are the results:

                                    <h4>Reception</h4>
                                    <p>
                                            All professors welcomed the idea of organizing a second visit in the balkan region, where we would have the opportunity to interact with students through synthetic biology workshops.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Dr Jasna Puizina, University of Split, told us that she was impressed that undergraduate students were involved in such a contemporary branch of science. She wanted to learn more about the iGEM Competition and shared with us her interest about the formation of an interbalkan iGEM team. She concluded that she will initiate discussions so that synthetic biology courses will be added in the faculty’s curriculum.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            We also had a discussion with Dr Alen Mujcinovic, University of Sarajevo, as he was interested in the entrepreneurship side of iGEM and synthetic biology’s applications in agriculture. He thought that involvement in the iGEM Competition would be a great opportunity for students of the faculty.

                                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                                    <p>
                                            As this was our first time presenting in front of such a large audience in English, we believe that this experience will prove very useful to us. We managed to communicate our work to people of other nationalities and interacted with numerous researchers in the Balkan region receiving their comments about our work.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Students participating in our event got to know a lot about Synthetic Biology and, through examples & discussion, understood how synthetic biological circuits can be used in real-world applications.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            We have already made plans to continue our activities in the Balkan region, with the organization of interactive workshops and presentations.

                                                    We believe that workshops is a great way to
                                                    introduce someone to a specific scientific
                                                    branch. An interactive approach gives the
                                                    individual the opportunity to to be more
                                                    involved in the learning process, promoting not

                                                    members of iGEM teams. Finally, they managed to
                                                    come up with innovative ways to tackle problems
                                                    such as wound healing, forest restoration and
                                                    infant food allergies. In the end, the
                                                    participants presented the ideas they had come
                                                    up with and before leaving they were asked to
                                                    fill in a short questionnaire regarding their
                                                    experience in the workshop.

                                                    Students of the faculty of Pharmacy, AUTH,
                                                    invited us to the Pharmacology Club where we
                                                    gave a speech about Synthetic Biology and its
                                                    contribution in Health Sciences and
                                                    Pharmacology. We spoke to them about the
                                                    production of artemisinin, an antimalarial
                                                    pharmaceutical compound, from yeast and
                                                    explained the advantages of this method of
                                                    production compared to the traditional
                                                    isolation of artemisinin from the
                                                    pharmaceutical plant. We, also, gave them
                                                    examples of iGEM Projects in the diagnostics
                                                    and therapeutics tracks. Specifically, we
                                                    presented the pANDORA (iGEM Greece 2017,
                                                    therapeutics), CATE (ETH Zurich 2017,
                                                    therapeutics) and Gotta Detect’ Em All
                                                    (INSA-Lyon 2016, diagnostics) projects and
                                                    after that we had an in depth conversation with
                                                    the students about the synthetic biology
                                                    circuits used in the aforementioned projects,
                                                    as well as the safety concerns they took into
                                                    consideration. We enjoyed interacting with
                                                    students that are eager to learn about science
                                                    beyond the classroom, gaining insight in the
                                                    measures that have to be taken for the
                                                    appropriate management of the safety risks of
                                                    drugs during their development phase and
                                                    post-marketing phase.

                                                    We visited Zarifeios Akadimia, a primary school
                                                    in Alexandroupoli, in order to spark the
                                                    students’ interest for science and introduce
                                                    them to the concept of synthetic biology. As we
                                                    wanted to actively include them in our
                                                    activity, we used candy as an example of DNA’s
                                                    structure and characteristics to construct an
                                                    edible DNA helix. Different color candy standed
                                                    for different nitrogenous bases, representing
                                                    how complementarity works in the DNA. Each
                                                    student built a different “DNA sequence” by
                                                    selecting different colored candy. This is how
                                                    we managed to explain that, in synthetic
                                                    biology, scientists can design their own DNA
                                                    sequences in order to achieve the desired
                                                    result. In addition, the students, with our
                                                    assistance, isolated DNA from bananas. This
                                                    way, we displayed that the DNA is not an
                                                    abstract concept, but it is a molecule of vital
                                                    importance that exists in every living
                                                    organism.

                                                    taking place in Alexandroupoli. The goal of the
                                                    congress is to bring students from all over the
                                                    country together, so that they can meet with
                                                    colleagues from different universities, get
                                                    hands-on experience and create presentations
                                                    and talks about interesting scientific topics.
                                                    So, we thought that the 3rd SRBW was an
                                                    excellent chance for us to introduce Synthetic
                                                    Biology to a crowd full of future scientists.
                                                    We gave a speech about Synthetic Biology, its
                                                    origins, tools and its vast number of
                                                    applications.

                                                    At the high school level, we came in contact
                                                    with two major educational institutions,
                                                    “Eniaio Ekpaideutiko Kentron” and “Frontistirio
                                                    Agrafiotis”. The owners and professors showed
                                                    interest in our project and we wanted to make
                                                    sure that the students could learn about an
                                                    interdisciplinary branch of science, synthetic
                                                    biology, as well as understand our project.
                                                    Even though we came in with high hopes, we
                                                    could not have imagined the amount of questions
                                                    and excitement that the students shown. During
                                                    our presentation, we explained them the basics
                                                    of synthetic biology by showing them exemplary
                                                    projects as well as the project we were
                                                    designing.

                                                    In our country, the final years of high school
                                                    tend to be very stressful and taxing for
                                                    students [1]. The PanHellenic exams are very
                                                    competitive and, on top of that, students
                                                    confront the difficult task of deciding their
                                                    school of preference/ preferred field of study/
                                                    career orientation in such a young age. We, as
                                                    an iGEM Team, are characterised by
                                                    interdisciplinarity and many of us could not
                                                    ever imagine that we would be involved in the
                                                    design of a biological system in an
                                                    undergraduate level. So, we made an effort to
                                                    highlight that interdisciplinarity [2] is one
                                                    of the main characteristics of modern academia
                                                    and industry, as well as that there are a lot
                                                    of opportunities to evolve and get into novel
                                                    scientific branches, such as Synthetic Biology.
                                                    Therefore, we believe that our interaction with
                                                    the students gave them the chance to learn
                                                    about contemporary science beyond school books.
                                                    In addition, we gave them examples proving that
                                                    their chosen field of study is not confining
                                                    and, through interdisciplinarity, they can
                                                    pursue their goals and get involved in exciting
                                                    projects and activities. We were thankful to
                                                    have the chance to promote science in such an
                                                    interactive way, and have made plans to further
                                                    extend our outreach after the competition.
