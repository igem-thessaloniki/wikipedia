                        As a project competing in the foundational advance track, we faced
                        difficulties in our efforts to properly communicate our work. We contacted
                        Asterios Arampatzis, Team Leader of iGEM Greece 2017, in order to gain some
                        insight about the problems they may have met and dealt with, regarding the
                        communication of Synthetic Biology and their project to the world. He
                        shared with us his experience, stating that synthetic biology is nearly
                        absent from our country, as the public has not been properly informed and
                        there are not many researchers in the field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This year, we wanted to make sure that the iGEM Foundation, and synthetic
                        biology in general, would come in attention of a larger audience. We aimed
                        to inform people of various ages, scientific backgrounds and nationalities
                        about this new and exciting, yet relatively unknown in our country,
                        scientific field, raise awareness about genetic engineering, discuss about
                        the important ethical issues that come up with synthetic biology’s constant
                        growth and receive valuable feedback for our project’s application and
                        importance to the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We organized numerous activities, differentiating our approach depending on
                        the audience. In order to familiarize them with synthetic biology we
                        presented several iGEM projects from previous years that we believed,
                        demonstrate that synthetic biology can prove beneficial in real world
                        problems. We, also, wanted to communicate our project, so wee could gain
                        some feedback and understand the public’s reception of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, taking into consideration public’s feedback, we wanted to address
                        the issue of science communication to the public. So, the <b>highlight of
                            our
                            activities</b> this year was the organization of the <b>“SynBalkans
                            Tour”</b>, an
                        educational effort in order to broaden the knowledge about synthetic
                        biology in the Balkan Region, considering the different cultural and
                        scientific background of the audience.

                                                    We believe that workshops is a great way to
                                                    introduce someone to a specific scientific
                                                    branch. An interactive approach gives the
                                                    individual the opportunity to to be more
                                                    involved in the learning process, promoting not
                                                    only knowledge, but creativity as well. So,in
                                                    collaboration with iGEM Athens and Dr.

                                                    Nanotechnology, University of Queensland, we
                                                    organised the first Synthetic Biology workshop
                                                    (SymBio) in Greece. The SynBio Workshop took
                                                    place at the event hall of National Technical
                                                    University of Athens. The participants had very

                                                    to chemical engineering.

                                                    After speeches from Dr K. Vavitsas (An

                                                    Professor Emeritus Fr. Kolisis (Systems and
                                                    Synthetic Biotechnology), iGEM Thessaloniki,
                                                    iGEM Athens and iGEM Greece (2017) presented
                                                    their projects to the audience. When the
                                                    presentations were over, Yvoni (iGEM
                                                    Thessaloniki) and Giannis (iGEM Athens) spoke
                                                    about the applications of engineering
                                                    principles in synthetic biology and explained
                                                    the use of some basic synthetic biology tools
                                                    (e.g. toggle switch, oscillator, riboswitch) in
                                                    order for the participants to be able to use
                                                    them in their brainstorming sessions. Leda
                                                    (iGEM Athens) talked about the safety
                                                    precautions and evaluation process that a
                                                    project should pass in order to be considered
                                                    safe.

                                                    The students were then divided into subgroups
                                                    and participated in a brainstorming session in
                                                    order to solve real world problems using
                                                    synthetic biology circuits, with help from
                                                    members of iGEM teams. Finally, they managed to
                                                    come up with innovative ways to tackle problems
                                                    such as wound healing, forest restoration and
                                                    infant food allergies. In the end, the
                                                    participants presented the ideas they had come
                                                    up with and before leaving they were asked to
                                                    fill in a short questionnaire regarding their
                                                    experience in the workshop.

                                                    Students of the faculty of Pharmacy, AUTH,
                                                    invited us to the Pharmacology Club where we
                                                    gave a speech about Synthetic Biology and its
                                                    contribution in Health Sciences and
                                                    Pharmacology. We spoke to them about the
                                                    production of artemisinin, an antimalarial
                                                    pharmaceutical compound, from yeast and
                                                    explained the advantages of this method of
                                                    production compared to the traditional
                                                    isolation of artemisinin from the
                                                    pharmaceutical plant. We, also, gave them
                                                    examples of iGEM Projects in the diagnostics
                                                    and therapeutics tracks. Specifically, we
                                                    presented the pANDORA (iGEM Greece 2017,
                                                    therapeutics), CATE (ETH Zurich 2017,
                                                    therapeutics) and Gotta Detect’ Em All
                                                    (INSA-Lyon 2016, diagnostics) projects and
                                                    after that we had an in depth conversation with
                                                    the students about the synthetic biology
                                                    circuits used in the aforementioned projects,
                                                    as well as the safety concerns they took into
                                                    consideration. We enjoyed interacting with
                                                    students that are eager to learn about science
                                                    beyond the classroom, gaining insight in the
                                                    measures that have to be taken for the
                                                    appropriate management of the safety risks of
                                                    drugs during their development phase and
                                                    post-marketing phase.

                                                    We visited Zarifeios Akadimia, a primary school
                                                    in Alexandroupoli, in order to spark the
                                                    students’ interest for science and introduce
                                                    them to the concept of synthetic biology. As we
                                                    wanted to actively include them in our
                                                    activity, we used candy as an example of DNA’s
                                                    structure and characteristics to construct an
                                                    edible DNA helix. Different color candy standed
                                                    for different nitrogenous bases, representing
                                                    how complementarity works in the DNA. Each
                                                    student built a different “DNA sequence” by
                                                    selecting different colored candy. This is how
                                                    we managed to explain that, in synthetic
                                                    biology, scientists can design their own DNA
                                                    sequences in order to achieve the desired
                                                    result. In addition, the students, with our
                                                    assistance, isolated DNA from bananas. This
                                                    way, we displayed that the DNA is not an
                                                    abstract concept, but it is a molecule of vital
                                                    importance that exists in every living
                                                    organism.

                                                    Student-Run Biology Workshop (SRBW) is a
                                                    congress organized by students of the
                                                    Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics
                                                    from the Democritus University of Thrace,
                                                    taking place in Alexandroupoli. The goal of the
                                                    congress is to bring students from all over the
                                                    country together, so that they can meet with
                                                    colleagues from different universities, get
                                                    hands-on experience and create presentations
                                                    and talks about interesting scientific topics.
                                                    So, we thought that the 3rd SRBW was an
                                                    excellent chance for us to introduce Synthetic
                                                    Biology to a crowd full of future scientists.
                                                    We gave a speech about Synthetic Biology, its
                                                    origins, tools and its vast number of
                                                    applications.

                                                    At the high school level, we came in contact
                                                    with two major educational institutions,
                                                    “Eniaio Ekpaideutiko Kentron” and “Frontistirio
                                                    Agrafiotis”. The owners and professors showed
                                                    interest in our project and we wanted to make
                                                    sure that the students could learn about an
                                                    interdisciplinary branch of science, synthetic
                                                    biology, as well as understand our project.
                                                    Even though we came in with high hopes, we
                                                    could not have imagined the amount of questions
                                                    and excitement that the students shown. During
                                                    our presentation, we explained them the basics
                                                    of synthetic biology by showing them exemplary
                                                    projects as well as the project we were
                                                    designing.

                                                    In our country, the final years of high school
                                                    tend to be very stressful and taxing for
                                                    students [1]. The PanHellenic exams are very
                                                    competitive and, on top of that, students
                                                    confront the difficult task of deciding their
                                                    school of preference/ preferred field of study/
                                                    career orientation in such a young age. We, as
                                                    an iGEM Team, are characterised by
                                                    interdisciplinarity and many of us could not
                                                    ever imagine that we would be involved in the
                                                    design of a biological system in an
                                                    undergraduate level. So, we made an effort to
                                                    highlight that interdisciplinarity [2] is one
                                                    of the main characteristics of modern academia
                                                    and industry, as well as that there are a lot
                                                    of opportunities to evolve and get into novel
                                                    scientific branches, such as Synthetic Biology.
                                                    Therefore, we believe that our interaction with
                                                    the students gave them the chance to learn
                                                    about contemporary science beyond school books.
                                                    In addition, we gave them examples proving that
                                                    their chosen field of study is not confining
                                                    and, through interdisciplinarity, they can
                                                    pursue their goals and get involved in exciting
                                                    projects and activities. We were thankful to
                                                    have the chance to promote science in such an
                                                    interactive way, and have made plans to further
                                                    extend our outreach after the competition.
